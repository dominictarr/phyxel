        it make a big difference which way around this is done.
        I had it like this before:

            body.origin
              .imul(2).isub(_origin)
              .iadd(getGravity(center, body.origin).imul(delta))        

        I noticed that all my planets would fall into the gravity well and be slingshot 
        out. some would then fall back into the well...
        they where loosing energy. I changed it, so that I add the acceleration 
        due to gravity first --  and it looks right. more stable orbits.

        another idea:
          variable timeslices with euler integration 
            -- give faster moving slices more steps.

    //sort bodies by thier speed, decending
    bodies.sort(function (a,b) {
      return b.speed - a.speed
    })
    var totalSpeed = 0
    console.log(bodies.map(function (b) {
      var s = Math.round(b.speed)
      totalSpeed += s
      return s
    }).join(','))


    function step(body, delta)  {
        /*
        // verlet integration (_origin is last tick's origin)
        body.origin
          .iadd(getGravity(center, body.origin).imul(delta))
          .imul(2).isub(_origin)
        */
        body.velocity.iadd(getGravity(center, body.origin).imul(delta))
        body.speed = body.velocity.length()
        body.origin.iadd(body.velocity.mul(delta))
    }

      give each body steps depending on the square of it's speed.
      this works fairly well. getting lots of quite stable highly eliptical orbits.
      interestingly, I'm not seeing many regular orbits.
      
      bodies do have a tendency to fall into the gravity well eventually...(rounding errors?)
      
      the body moves quickly at the perigee, but slowly at the apogee.
      approximating the curve with many straight lines is more accurate when 
      you use more lines. the apogee uses many slices, since it's moving slowly.
      I have made it use more slices at the perigee, but is it the same number 
      of steps per distance traveled?
      
      also, note at the perigee the steps (thus the delta) is very small. 
      could this cause rounding error? at the apogee the speed is very small,
      could this balance out the small delta at the perigee?
      
      currently, I always doing at least one step per frame, maybe it would be better 
      to update steps per object independent of frames... 
      so that it does not loose energy.
      
      another (heavy) approach would just be to use BigDecimals. 
      though, that will be much slower it would be better to just not care.
