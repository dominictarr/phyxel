# Phyxel

experimental voxel based 2d physics.


THIS IS JUST A ORBIT SIMULATOR, FOR NOW


CRAZY IDEA

fluids:

  gas light, non dense, possibly moving partices, not sticky.
  
  liquids: denser, sticky, surface tension.
  
solids:

  solid: dense, stiffly stuck to other solid things, but can be flexible or brittle.
         connections can have a direction, so a chain can have stiffness, and brittleness.

advantages:

  simpler simulation,
    each phyxel has a few simple properties, that my affect neibouring phyxels. (say, 6)
    instead of having alot of complicated rules and checks. just make every thing a circle.
    
ideas:

  would be cool to be able to freeze or melt parts of a game level, 
  freeze to make it brittle, then smash it. melt through things, 
  float on water or fly in the air maybe?
  
  maybe it'll be better to make the phyxels "large"... and lift wont work right.
  that is okay, also, the entities in the game might be werid. walking and stuff... 
  maybe should just have them roll sideways, hover, or allow a few 'magical' forces.
